stdlib.h 
noreturn void abort(void);

- Cause abnormal process termination

- Raises the SIGABRT signal

- Returns an implementation defined code indicating unsuccessful termination

- Causes noticeable failure, dump core and generate core file

- No files closed, no streams closed, temp files not deleted

- If the SIGABRT signal is ignored, 
    or caught by a handler that returns, 
    the abort() function will still terminate the process. 
    It does this by restoring the default disposition 
    for SIGABRT and then raising the signal for a second time.
