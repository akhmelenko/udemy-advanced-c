int atexit(void (*function)(void)); 
- Register a function to be called at normal process termination

- Can register up to ATEXIT_MAX (32) functions

- Returns: 
    the value 0 if successful; otherwise it returns a nonzero value.

- When a child process is created via fork(2), 
    it inherits copies of its parent's registrations.  
    Upon a successful call to one of the exec(3) functions, 
    all registrations are removed.

- Exit functions calls in backward order

- Work with exit() and without it
