#include <time.h>
clock_t clock(void);

- Returns an approximation of processor time used by the program

- To get the number of seconds used, divide by CLOCKS_PER_SEC

- -1: If the processor time used is not available or its value cannot be represented, the function returns the value (clock_t) 



time_t time(time_t *tloc);

- Returns the time as the number of seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).

- If tloc is non-NULL, the return value is also stored in the memory pointed to by tloc.

- On error,  -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error




double difftime(time_t time1, time_t time0);

- Returns the number of seconds elapsed between time time1 and time time0, 
represented as a double
